      "title": "What is Vibe Coding?",
      "body": "Vibe coding is a collaborative programming approach that emphasizes flow state, creative experimentation, and community-driven development. Unlike traditional solo coding sessions, vibe coding brings developers together in a relaxed, supportive environment where ideas flow freely and learning happens organically.\n\nAt its core, vibe coding is about creating a positive, low-pressure atmosphere where developers can explore new technologies, share knowledge, and build projects together. It's less about deadlines and deliverables, and more about the joy of coding, discovery, and connection."

    {
      "title": "How to Get Started",
      "body": "Getting started with vibe coding is simple and accessible:\n\n1. **Find Your Community**: Join local coding meetups, online communities, or organize sessions with friends and colleagues.\n\n2. **Set the Right Environment**: Choose a comfortable space with good lighting, snacks, and a collaborative atmosphere. Virtual sessions work great too!\n\n3. **Choose a Project**: Pick something interesting but not too complex. The goal is exploration, not perfection.\n\n4. **Start Coding Together**: Pair up or work in small groups. Share screens, discuss approaches, and learn from each other.\n\n5. **Embrace Experimentation**: Try new frameworks, languages, or tools. The focus is on learning and having fun.\n\n6. **Document and Share**: Keep notes, share what you learned, and contribute back to the community.\n\nRemember, vibe coding is about the journey, not the destination. Enjoy the process!"
