You maintain sovereignty over your funds, but may need to manage Lightning channels yourself (though some wallets automate this). Examples include Phoenix, Breez, ZEUS, and Muun.

For custodial wallets, you're trusting the service with your funds (like a bank). For non-custodial wallets, you're responsible for security. Start with small amounts when learning, and never share your private keys or recovery phrase with anyone.",

Other Layer 2s include RGB (client-side validated smart contracts), Stacks (smart contracts with Bitcoin finality), Liquid (federated sidechain), Rollups (various scaling proposals), and Fedimint (federated Chaumian e-cash mints).
