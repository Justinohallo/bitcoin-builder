Code flows into GitHub, deploys to Vercel previews, and returns with feedback in minutes."

The same vibe coding habits will power each milestone."

The project started with conversations about the challenges merchants face—from technical integration to customer education—and evolved into a vision for a community-driven platform. Through collaboration with merchants, developers, and the broader Bitcoin community, the website took shape as both a practical tool and a symbol of Bitcoin commerce growth."

Instead of airline miles or hotel points, JP wanted something better—something that teaches people about Bitcoin. The presentation covers how Bitpoints.me merges Cashu with Bitchat to create an interoperable, educational rewards platform where users see 'points' but behind the scenes they're 1:1 pegged to sats.

But what they don't realize is: points get devalued in fiat terms, then they get devalued again by the issuer, and they're locked into platforms with zero interoperability. Traditional rewards systems like airline miles and hotel points are essentially the biggest shitcoins of all time—they lose value and trap users in closed ecosystems."

So I forked cashu.me, rebranded it, and launched a quick PWA: points.trailscoffee.com. Users see 'points.' But behind the scenes, they're 1:1 pegged to sats. The mint shows sats. The wallet shows points. Simple UX. No friction. Just like a gift card—no login, just a code."

Then came the crazy idea: merge Bitchat with Cashu. Why? So kids could use their balance at the coffeeshop offline. Cashu tokens are bearer instruments. As long as the POS is online, they clear."
