      "title": "Why GitHub Matters for Open Source",
      "body": "GitHub is the world's largest platform for open source software development. While it's built for developers, it's also a powerful tool for anyone who wants to participate in open source projects—including product managers, designers, writers, researchers, and community members.\n\nYou don't need to write code to make valuable contributions. GitHub enables you to:\n\n• Report bugs and issues you discover\n• Suggest new features and improvements\n• Propose workflow and process changes\n• Contribute documentation and guides\n• Participate in discussions and planning\n• Review and provide feedback on proposals\n• Help organize and prioritize work\n\nAt Builder, we believe that great products come from diverse perspectives. Non-developers bring crucial insights about user experience, business logic, and community needs. GitHub provides the tools to turn those insights into actionable contributions that shape the future of open source projects."

      "title": "Understanding GitHub Basics",
      "body": "Before diving into workflows, let's understand the core concepts:\n\nRepository (Repo): A project's home on GitHub. It contains all the files, documentation, and history of a project. Think of it as a folder that tracks every change.\n\nIssue: A way to track bugs, feature requests, questions, or tasks. Issues are like tickets that help organize work and discussions.\n\nPull Request (PR): A proposal to make changes to a project. Even if you're not writing code, you can create PRs to update documentation, suggest process changes, or propose new content.\n\nFork: Your own copy of a repository. You can make changes in your fork without affecting the original project.\n\nBranch: A parallel version of the project where you can make changes safely. Think of it as a draft that doesn't affect the main version.\n\nThese concepts work together to create a collaborative workflow where anyone can contribute, and changes are reviewed before being merged into the main project."

      "title": "Getting Started: Setting Up Your GitHub Account",
      "body": "Creating a GitHub account is free and takes just a few minutes:\n\n1. Go to github.com and click \"Sign up\"\n2. Choose a username that represents you professionally\n3.

      "title": "Reporting Issues and Bugs",
      "body": "One of the most valuable contributions non-developers can make is reporting issues. Your fresh perspective often catches problems developers miss.\n\nHow to Report an Issue:\n\n1. Navigate to the repository's \"Issues\" tab\n2. Click \"New Issue\"\n3. Check if a similar issue already exists (search first!)\n4. Choose the appropriate issue template if available\n5. Fill out the form with:\n   • Clear, descriptive title\n   • Steps to reproduce the problem\n   • Expected vs. actual behavior\n   • Screenshots or examples if relevant\n   • Your environment (browser, OS, etc.)\n\nBest Practices:\n• Be specific and detailed\n• Include screenshots or screen recordings\n• Test on different devices/browsers if possible\n• Be respectful and constructive\n• Follow up if developers ask questions\n\nExample Good Issue Title: \"Documentation link broken on Getting Started page\"\nExample Bad Issue Title: \"Help!\" or \"Something's wrong\"\n\nRemember: Every issue report helps improve the project, even if it seems small. Your user perspective is invaluable."

      "title": "Suggesting Features and Improvements",
      "body": "As a product manager or user, you have unique insights into what features would be valuable. GitHub makes it easy to share these ideas.\n\nFeature Request Process:\n\n1. Check existing issues to see if your idea has been discussed\n2. Create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" label (if available)\n3. Clearly describe:\n   • The problem you're trying to solve\n   • Your proposed solution\n   • Why this would be valuable\n   • Potential use cases or examples\n\nWriting Effective Feature Requests:\n\n• Start with the user's problem, not the solution\n• Explain the \"why\" behind your suggestion\n• Provide context: who would use this? When? How?\n• Consider edge cases and alternatives\n• Be open to discussion and refinement\n\nExample Structure:\n\"As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].\"\n\nExample: \"As a product manager, I want to see a roadmap visualization so that I can better communicate project timelines to stakeholders.\"\n\nPro Tip: Engage with the community. Respond to questions, provide additional context, and help refine the idea through discussion. The best features emerge from collaboration."

      "title": "Proposing Workflow and Process Changes",
      "body": "Non-developers often have valuable insights about how projects can be better organized, documented, or managed. GitHub provides tools to propose these improvements.\n\nCommon Workflow Improvements:\n\n• Documentation structure and organization\n• Issue templates and labels\n• Contribution guidelines\n• Release processes\n• Communication protocols\n• Onboarding procedures\n• Community guidelines\n\nHow to Propose Workflow Changes:\n\n1. Create an issue discussing the current process and proposed improvement\n2. Get community feedback and consensus\n3. If it involves documentation, create a Pull Request with the changes\n4. Reference the discussion issue in your PR\n5. Work with maintainers to refine and merge\n\nCreating Documentation PRs:\n\nEven without coding skills, you can:\n• Edit markdown files (GitHub's web editor makes this easy)\n• Improve clarity and organization\n• Add examples and use cases\n• Fix typos and formatting\n• Translate documentation\n\nStep-by-Step for Documentation PR:\n\n1. Navigate to the file you want to edit\n2. Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)\n3. Make your changes in the web editor\n4. Preview your changes\n5. Write a clear commit message describing your changes\n6. Click \"Propose changes\"\n7. Fill out the Pull Request form explaining your changes\n8. Submit and wait for review\n\nRemember: Small improvements add up. Every typo fixed, every clarification added, makes the project more accessible to others."

They:\n• Created an issue describing the gap\n• Proposed specific documentation changes\n• Created a PR with the improvements\n• Worked with maintainers to refine the wording\n• Result: Better onboarding experience for all new users\n\nExample 2: Feature Prioritization\n\nA community member analyzed user feedback and:\n• Compiled common feature requests\n• Created a prioritized list with user value justification\n• Facilitated discussion to reach consensus\n• Result: Project roadmap aligned with user needs\n\nExample 3: Process Improvement\n\nA designer noticed that design proposals were getting lost. They:\n• Proposed a new issue template for design proposals\n• Created the template with appropriate fields\n• Updated contribution guidelines\n• Result: Better organization and visibility of design work\n\nExample 4: User Research\n\nA researcher conducted user interviews and:\n• Documented findings in issues\n• Created user personas\n• Provided insights for feature development\n• Result: More user-centered product decisions\n\nThese examples show that non-developer contributions are just as valuable as code contributions."
